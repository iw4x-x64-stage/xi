# xi - Internal foundation for IW4x projects.

The `xi` project, short for X internal, holds the foundation that the IW4x
projects build on. Its `libxi` library carries the facilities these projects
share, so that each one is written and tested once.

This file contains setup instructions and other details that are more
appropriate for development rather than consumption. If you want to use
`libxi` in your `build2`-based project, then instead see the accompanying
package [`README.md`](libxi/README.md) file.

## Development

The development setup for `xi` uses the standard `bdep`-based workflow. On
Linux we build natively with GCC and also cross-compile for Windows with
MinGW-w64 GCC, running the tests under Wine with `WINEPATH` pointing to the
directories that contain the MinGW runtime DLLs (as found on Fedora in the
example below). For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/iw4x-x64-stage/xi.git
cd xi

bdep init -C @gcc cc config.cxx=g++
bdep init -C @mingw cc config.cxx=x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ \
  config.test.runner="env WINEPATH=/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/bin wine"
bdep update -a
bdep test -a
```

On Windows we build with MSVC from the x64 Native Tools Command Prompt or
the matching PowerShell, which builds 64-bit binaries. For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/iw4x-x64-stage/xi.git
cd xi

bdep init -C -@msvc cc config.cxx=cl
bdep update
bdep test
```
